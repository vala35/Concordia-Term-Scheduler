___
A (soon-to-be) sleek web application combining a **Node.js/Express** backend with a **React** frontend to revolutionize course sequence planning for Concordia University's co-op students.

---

## Overview
Concordia's co-op program often challenges students to create custom course sequences when deviating from the recommended ones. Traditionally, this involves manually organizing a list of courses by term—a process prone to errors and frustration due to limited visibility of course offerings.

**This app changes the game**, offering a streamlined, intuitive way to organize and adjust course sequences. Future iterations aim to expand the app into a comprehensive university schedule management tool.

---

##  Features
- **Streamlined Course Planning**: Simplify the organization and adjustment of course sequences.
- **Historical Data Insights**: Dive into past course offerings for better term planning.
- **Co-op Student Focused**: Tailored for students creating flexible and efficient schedules.
- **API-Powered**: Built on Concordia University's OpenData API (no direct affiliation).

### Functionality

- Tailored for co-op students needing clarity and reorganization of their sequences.

### Disclaimer

## Known Issues

---

## Future Improvements
